   https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
   ```
2. Send a message to your bot in Telegram, then refresh the link.  
3. Locate `"chat":{"id":<YOUR_CHAT_ID>}` in the response and **copy the chat ID**.  

### **4. Configure the Script**  
Edit `config.py` (or modify `BOT_TOKEN` and `CHAT_ID` in the script directly):  
```python
BOT_TOKEN = "your-bot-token"
CHAT_ID = "your-chat-id"
```

### **5. Define the Files to Monitor**  
Edit the `FILES_TO_WATCH` list in the script:
